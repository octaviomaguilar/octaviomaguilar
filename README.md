## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently working on projects related to the labor market effects of online learning, the macroeconomic effects of transitioning to remote work, and the empirical regularities of energy consumption in the U.S.
- 🌱 Additional early-stage projects involve examining the relationship between automation and jobless recoveries, as well as analyzing the macroeconomic effects of online learning.
- 😄 I am currently applying to PhD programs! Fingers crossed!
- 🐶 Fun fact: I have a 3 year old yellow lab named Totti!
