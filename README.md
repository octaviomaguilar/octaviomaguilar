## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently working on projects related to the labor market effects of online learning, the macroeconomic effects of transitioning to remote work, and the empirical regularities of energy consumption in the U.S.
- 🌱 Additional early-stage projects involve examining the relationship between automation and jobless recoveries, as well as analyzing the industry level effects of online learning.
- 🐶 Fun fact: I have a 3 year old yellow lab named Totti!
